# Random dungeon generation

## About the project

I had the idea to make this project when researching about Procedural generation and found [this video](https://youtu.be/G2_SGhmdYFo?si=M4CfwychRCAZVtW9).

I failed to implement it to my liking and so I had to redo some parts of the original code, since I also used the plugin [Better Terrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ia6yOKKiGg&t=232s) I decided that it would make for a good video and so I'm leaving the code under MIT license for anyone to use.

## The project

The code has exported variables and it is documented, each scene is seperated within files so you can just move that file to another project and it will work the same, just remember to change the tileset.

If you do not wish to use the Better Terrain plugin you can go through the code and delete the regions defined as **BetterTerrain**.
